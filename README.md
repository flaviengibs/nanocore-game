# How to get the instructions
## Two methods
### First method
Open the game ( https://flaviengibs.github.io/nanocore-game/ )

Then click on Instructions (at the right of "Nanocore" at the top of the website)

This will open you a brand new page with all the instructions to play to the game. 


### Second method
Go on this website : https://flaviengibs.github.io/nanocore-instructions/

It is the same website as the instructions website of the first method, but with the link.
